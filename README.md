# QuickDry

QuickDry is a simple note-taking app that I wrote to have a place that I can quickly jot down notes, but still be able to search back into the past if I need it. (Search is currently only accessible via the Export Markdown file)

To run this for yourself:

- `bundle install`
- `yarn install`
- `bin/dev`
- open http://localhost:3333

This will start the application at port 3333 by default. To use a different port, define a `QD_PORT` var like so: `QD_PORT=1234 bin/dev`
